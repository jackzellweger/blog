# Living by design
Instructor: Thomas Bailer

- If something goes away after 3 days, how important was it really?
- Treat your personal life with the same attention as your work life.
- Create a clear vision by imagining a movie of your future self.
- Schedule time for your goals and strategic thinking.
- Ask yourself: what would happen if I just didn't do this thing?
- Carve out time for what matters to you.
- Everything either contributes to, is neutral to, or detracts from your life.
- You'll know when it's time to let something go.
- When you say "tomorrow," let that be a warning signal.
- When something becomes "Too Fucking Hard" to ignore, deal with it immediately.
- Most decisions are reversible - stop overthinking them.
- Track your time to see your real priorities.
- Go big.
