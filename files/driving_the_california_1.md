After you've gotten the beer, head to the hill in the corner furthest away from Delfinaâ€”past the playground. Sit on the hill and drink your beer. From there, you'll have fantastic views of the bay and downtown San Francisco. I frequented this park when I lived in Marin an worked downtown. It's a classic San Francisco spot!

Head to the beach near the Golden Gate bridge for a nice walk along the sand. You can either go to Crissy Beach via Jauss St., a little farther East, or you can head to Golden Gate Beach via Marine Dr., more westward.
### If It's A Clear Day, Head To The Ferry Building Then Angel Island
Head to the Ferry Building to catch the Angel Island ferry. [Schedule.](https://www.goldengate.org/assets/1/6/spring_summer25_%28final%29.pdf?12185) Get to the foot of Market Street & Embarcadero, Gates B & C behind SF Ferry Building.
> Once on the island, enjoy the 5-mile perimeter road hike with stunning 360Â° views of the Bay Area. Visit the Immigration Station museum to learn about the island's history, and be sure to climb to the top of Mount Livermore (788 feet) for breathtaking panoramic views of San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge, and Marin Headlands. Pack a picnic lunch to enjoy at one of the many scenic spots around the island.
### If It's Cloudy, Head To Mount Tamalpais
> Drive up to Mount Tamalpais State Park and explore the Cataract Falls Trail, one of Marin's most beautiful hiking experiences, especially after rainfall when the cascading waterfalls are at their most impressive. The trail features multiple waterfall sections connected by scenic forest paths. Be prepared for steps and some moderate climbing. Afterward, continue to the East Peak summit for sweeping views that often rise above the cloud layer. Consider stopping at the Mountain Home Inn or Tourist Club (if open) for refreshments on your way back.

> But my favorite hike ever is cataract falls in the Tamalpais watershed - lots of stairs though Alternately Angel Island is absolutely glorious on a clear day It's an easy ferry ride from the ferry building
